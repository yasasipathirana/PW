      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Hello!üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</b> I'm Yasasi Pathirana, an undergraduate studying information technology. 
        I can't wait to explore the digital world. I'm eager to study computer systems in-depth, 
        pick up coding, and comprehend how networks work. Whether I want to build innovative software 
        or make sure that everything is secure online, my IT degree will provide me the tools I need to 
        really make an impact. I'm excited to put into practice my creative thinking, solve difficult 
        challenges, and keep up with the most recent developments in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are endless possibilities and I'm prepared to explore them all!
